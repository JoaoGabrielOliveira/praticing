## Intro

This repository is to save small projects then I made to pratice my knowledges.

Here, I will made a small API with front-end to sell cars.

We have 3 mainly endpoints:

/car
```json
    [
        {"id":"aa271e88-721e-42df-9cda-edaf3a298737", "model_id":1, "price":20000.20}
    ]
```

/car-model
```json
    [
        {"id":1,"model":"Gol", "year":2002, "brand_id":1}
    ]
```

/car-brand
```json
    [
        {"id":1,"name":"Volkswagen"}
    ]
```


## NOTE

- For each project it has a separate branch.
- The branch name needs to be named with the programming language as suffix
